   nats-cluster.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local

NATS monitoring service can be accessed via port 8222 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:

    nats-cluster-mgmt.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local

To access the Monitoring svc from outside the cluster, follow the steps below:

1. Get the name of a pod from the cluster that was deployed, then use port-forward to connect top it. For example:

    kubectl get pods -l nats_cluster=nats-cluster
    kubectl port-forward nats-cluster-1 8222

2. Open a browser and access the NATS monitoring browsing to the Monitoring URL
